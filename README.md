# Simple Calculator with Tkinter

A user-friendly Simple Calculator built with Python's Tkinter library. This calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. It dynamically displays the entire calculation string (e.g., 74+4) and computes the result as soon as an operator is pressed.


## Features
- Real-Time Calculation Display: Displays the input numbers and operators sequentially for better understanding.
- Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs gracefully with clear error messages.
- Interactive UI: Responsive design with well-spaced buttons and intuitive layout.
- Basic Operations Supported:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Division (/)
  - Modulus (%)
- Additional Functionalities:
  - Reset (RESET) to clear the calculation.
  - Delete (DEL) to remove the last entered character.
  - Equal (=) to compute and display the final result.
